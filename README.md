# I demonstrate deploying a .Net 7 application using ASP.NET Core with SignalR library on IBM Power Systems with OpenShift.
# I created this demonstration as an Italian ISV required ASP.Net with SignalR support to port their application to IBM Power Systems. 
# I created the application on my x86 laptop using Visual Studio.
# The project is stored in the GitHub repository and can be deployed on x86 or IBM Power ppc64le platforms.
# There are two demonstrations in the recording.
# The first is created from my GitHub repository using the command line on a Bastion Server.
# The second (7:45) is deployed using the OpenShift GUI User Interface Source to Image functionality.
